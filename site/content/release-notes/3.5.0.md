RDF4J 3.5.0 is a minor release with several improvements and bug fixes.

Some highlights:

- new modules `rdf4j-model-api` and `rdf4j-model-vocabulary` for leaner dependency footprint in lightweight projects;
- improved performance of remote SPARQL query result pass-through;
- improved suport for custom character encoding in RDF and query result writers;
- support for Java 15;

## Upgrade notes

RDF4J 3.5.0 is binary compatible with older RDF4J releases.

Nevertheless, when upgrading existing projects, the following should be taken into account:

### Maven dependencies

The `rdf4j-model` module has been split into three separate modules: `rdf4j-model-api`, `rdf4j-model-vocabulary`, and `rdf4j-model`.

If your project does not use transitive dependency resolution for the RDF4J modules, you will need to add two new additional dependencies to your project configuration:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.rdf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>rdf4j-model-api</artifactId>
    <version>3.5.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.rdf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>rdf4j-model-vocabulary</artifactId>
    <version>3.5.0</version>
</dependency>
```
